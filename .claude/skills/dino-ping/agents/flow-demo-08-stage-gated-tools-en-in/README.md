# F08 — Stage-Gated Tools

PNG previews are not bundled.

Demonstrates stage allow-lists over one agent-owned, multi-operation CRM
component. `verify_pin` is available only at the identity gate; account lookup
becomes available only after successful routing to the next stage. Calls made
too early receive flow-authored corrective guidance.

Commands use `dino` for production; substitute `dino-staging` for staging.
Follow the installed Ping skill's release and approval gates.

Audio is not bundled. Before validation or publication, follow the
[audio setup](../../references/agents/gemini-tts.md) to write the four lifecycle
lines and configure a Gemini credential. Generate all four recordings first:

```text
dino agent generate-audio --agent-dir <absolute-agent-dir> --input <absolute-audio.json>
```

Build, independently verify, then validate:

```text
dino integration build --agent-dir <absolute-agent-dir> --name demo_crm_embedded
dino integration verify --component <artifact-from-build-result>
dino agent validate --agent-dir <absolute-agent-dir>
```

Only when requested, generate a local preview after approval:

```text
dino agent render --agent-dir <absolute-agent-dir> --output <absolute-agent-dir>/preview.png --overwrite
```
